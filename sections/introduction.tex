\section*{Introduction}
The given task is to model a toll system. The system consist of a bridge with a number of check in and check out lanes. The users of the system is able to check in and thereby use the bridge. When the desired destination is reached, the user can check out. 
The report will be focusing on 4 different use cases, which then functions as the core of the design. We model all the diagrams in a way so the chosen usecases can be realized.
